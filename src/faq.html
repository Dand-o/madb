        <b>1. Why is misinformation on social media so dangerous?</b><br />
        Misinformation harms: It can lead to wrong decisions about health,
        politics, and important events. It can also cause distrust and division
        in communities. Spreads quickly: Social media is designed for sharing.
        False information can spread like wildfire, especially when it triggers
        strong emotions.<br />
        <br />

          2. How do I know if something I see online is fake news or
          misinformation?</b
        >
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Sensational Headlines: Headlines designed to grab your attention
            with shocking claims, ALL CAPS, and lots of exclamation points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Suspicious Sources: Websites with unfamiliar names, strange
            spellings (.co instead of .com), or those that mimic real news
            outlets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lack of Evidence: Claims without credible sources or data to back
            them up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Playing on Emotions: Content that makes you feel overly angry,
            scared, or excited to the point where you may overlook inaccuracies.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <b>3. What can I do to stop the spread of misinformation?</b><br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fact-Check: Before sharing anything, verify it with trusted sources.
            See if reputable news sites are reporting the same thing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think Critically: Question the source, consider the author's
            motives, and look for evidence
          </li>
          <li>
            Speak Up: If you see friends or family sharing misinformation,
            gently correct them with reliable information. Don't be afraid to
            call out fake news.
          </li>
          <li>
            Report: Social media platforms often have ways to report harmful
            misinformation.

            >My friend keeps sharing stuff that I think is fake. How do I talk
            to them about it?</b
          ><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Be Empathetic: Avoid being accusatory or dismissive. Start by
              understanding their perspective.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Ask Questions: Instead of directly stating something is wrong,
              ask, "Where did you find this?," "Are there any other sources
              reporting this?," or "What makes this seem trustworthy?".
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Offer Alternatives: Suggest checking out fact-checking websites
              together.
